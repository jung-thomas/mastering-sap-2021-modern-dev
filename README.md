[Mastering SAP OnAir 2021 Master Class Site](https://masteringsapconference.com/msap/aus/masterclasses/)

This is a broad masterclass session will look at the role of Business Application Studio and VSCode in the modern SAP development space. We will see how to get started with both community tooling and SAP provided tooling in each environment to support HANA, CAP, Fiori, Mobile and even ABAP development.

## Part 1
Getting setup for development in both Business Application Studio and VSCode locally. We will show the basics of getting started in each environment. We will see how to configure development spaces and why they are needed. How to install SAP ecosystem friendly VSCode extensions.  How to setup a test and debug environment in both tools. Basically get a developer setup for all types of modern development in the SAP tools space.

But I’m an ABAP developer. Let’s bring the workshop back around to where most of us started – ABAP.  Although ABAP tooling isn’t official offered outside of Eclipse; let’s look at the state of community tooling in VSCode. Also let’s see how CAP, Fiori, and HANA tooling plays alongside the ABAP development experience.
